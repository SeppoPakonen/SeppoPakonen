- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sgebe89, a songwriter, but I also know how to program a bit.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in *current things* (twitter, gettr, hackernews, zerohedge, globalresearch, naturalnews, youtube, infowars)
- I've been using Linux or BSD regularly since 2003 (since Mandrake 9.2)
- I have chronic pain and my irritation threshold is low, especially with ugly practices, old-fashioned standard solutions, unnecessary verbiage and non-RAII solutions.
